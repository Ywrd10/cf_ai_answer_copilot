# AI Usage and Prompts

AI assistance was used during development to help with design decisions, debugging, and iterating on implementation details. All generated suggestions were reviewed, modified, and tested manually.

## In-App System Prompt
Used by the application when generating internship responses:

"You help a college computer science student write clear and natural internship application answers based on their background and the question provided."

## Development Prompts
Examples of prompts used while building the project:

- "Help me design a simple Cloudflare Worker API that accepts user input and returns an AI-generated response."
- "How can I store per-user state using Durable Objects?"
- "Show a basic example of calling Workers AI from a Worker."
- "Help debug a CORS issue between Cloudflare Pages and a Worker."
- "Explain how to proxy API routes from Pages to a Worker."

AI was used as a development aid, not as a replacement for understanding or implementation.
